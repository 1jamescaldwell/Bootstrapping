This R script demonstrates the concept of bootstrapping as a method for quantifying uncertainty in a fitted curve. Itgenerates synthetic data using a defined data-generating process, fits a polynomial model to the data, andvisualizes the true model alongside bootstrap samples and their confidence intervals. The script begins by definingfunctions for simulating data and the true mean function. It then generates synthetic data, creates scatterplots, fitspolynomial models, and plots the true model and bootstrapped samples. The bootstrap resampling processinvolves randomly sampling observations with replacement from the original dataset, fitting polynomial models toeach bootstrap sample, and calculating confidence intervals for the fitted curves.
